# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on personal portfolio site using HTML & CSS, added to Codepen and submitted to Free Code Camp as Portfolio project

**Thoughts:** I'm feeling more comfortable using HTML & CSS and am starting to get more comfortable using Flexbox. I'm focusing on DRY coding and making sure it's clean & has good comments.
