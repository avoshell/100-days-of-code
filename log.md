# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on personal portfolio site using HTML & CSS, added to Codepen and submitted to Free Code Camp as Portfolio project; Also worked on Free Code Camp Javascript algorithm scripting challenges.

**Thoughts:** I'm feeling more comfortable using HTML & CSS and am starting to get more comfortable using Flexbox. I'm focusing on DRY coding and making sure it's clean & has good comments.

**Today's Progress**: Started new site - The Sustenance Project, a fictional restaurant aimed towards using local food makers and reducing waste by donating excess food to those in need and getting community involved in green food production; attend DSM Front End meetup & learned about upcoming CSS Grid

**Thoughts:** Working on creating more projects to add to portfolio; CSS Grid sounds like a great feature and I hope to start using it soon in experimental dev environment
